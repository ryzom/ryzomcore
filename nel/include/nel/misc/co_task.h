	/** The coroutine task class encapsulate the coroutines detail and provide
	 *	an easy to use simple master/slave coroutine model.
	 *	The concept is that the main thread is the 'master' (or parent) coroutine
	 *	and that the task is run by a slave coroutine.
	 *	Therefore, you can 'start' the task, 'yield' the focus from the task to it's
	 *	parent, 'resume' the task from the parent, check for termination of the task,
	 *	and/or wait for it.
	 *
	 *	Note that for safety reasons, the CCoTask do not provide mean to for
	 *	the termination of the task. Like for threads, 'killing' a task while
	 *	destroy the task stack without calling destructor of any object create
	 *	on the stack. This can lead to memory leaks or atomic destruction of
	 *	earth (if used inside an ICBM control program).
	 *	So, as a rule of thumb, (valid for thread as well), you should always
	 *	design your code so your coroutines are cleanly terminated before
	 *	your program end.
	 *
	 *	If you don't know about coroutines, a short description follow :
	 *		* Coroutines are some sort of multi-threading
	 *		* Coroutines are not preemptive, it's the application code that choose
	 *			task swapping point
	 *		* thus, coroutines don't need heavy synchronization (like mutex)
	 *		* coroutines are said to be lighter than thread during context switch
	 *		* coroutines don't replace preemptives threads, they have their own application domain
	 *
	 *
	 *	Please note that this class is really simple (compared to what can be done with coroutines)
	 *	but match the need for a very simple mean to have two task running side by side with
	 *	predefined sync point.
	 *	You can build the same think using thread and mutex, but it will be a lot more complex
	 *	to build and debug.
	 *
	 *  A simple sample :
	 *	CMyTask : public CCoTask
	 *	{
	 *	public:
	 *		void run()
	 *		{
	 *			for (uint i=0; i<7; ++i)
	 *			{
	 *				printf("CoTask : %i\n", i)
	 *				// leave control to parent task
	 *				yield();
	 *			}
	 *		}
	 *	};
	 *
	 *	uint main()
	 *	{
	 *		CMyTask task;
	 *		// start the task, block until task terminate or call 'yield'
	 *		task.resume();
	 *
	 *		for (uint i=0; i<5; ++i)
	 *		{
	 *			printf("Main : %i\n", i);
	 *			// let the task run a bit
	 *			task.resume();
	 *		}
	 *
	 *		// wait for task completion
	 *		task.wait();
	 *	}
	 *
	 *	This little proggy will output the following :
	 *	*********** Output *************
	 *	CoTask : 1
	 *	Main : 1
	 *	CoTask : 2
	 *	Main : 2
	 *	CoTask : 3
	 *	Main : 3
	 *	CoTask : 4
	 *	Main : 4
	 *	CoTask : 5
	 *	CoTask : 6
	 *	*********** End of output ********
