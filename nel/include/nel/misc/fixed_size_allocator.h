/** An allocator that can allocate and deallocate blocks of fixed size in O(1)
  * Blocks are managed by chunks. Any number of blocks can be allocated, but once
  * a block is allocated, a whole chunk need to be.
  * With 32 bits pointers, there may be a 4 - 12 bytes overhead per object
  * NB: Unlike CBlockManager, when a chunk contains no allocated blocks, it will be freed.
  *     If only one chunk remains, it isn't deleted, however.
  *     Another motivation for that class is that it can be used for a memory arena style allocator, because
  *     size isn't a fixed parameter of template. A fixed size allocator implemented as a template for type T can be layered on this implementation.
  *
  * NB : number of blocks per chunks must be at least 3
