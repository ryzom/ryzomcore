 * \brief IAudioDecoder
 * \date 2008-08-30 11:38GMT
 * \author Jan Boon (Kaetemi)
 * IAudioDecoder is only used by the driver implementation to stream 
 * music files into a readable format (it's a simple decoder interface).
 * You should not call these functions (getSongTitle) on nlsound or user level, 
 * as a driver might have additional music types implemented.
 * TODO: Split IAudioDecoder into IAudioDecoder (actual decoding) and IMediaDemuxer (stream splitter), and change the interface to make more sense.
 * TODO: Allow user application to register more decoders.
 * TODO: Look into libavcodec for decoding audio?
