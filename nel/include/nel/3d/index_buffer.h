/**
 * An index buffer to work with the driver
 *
 * Before the index buffer is resident (IDriver::activeIndexBuffer), it is in system memory.
 * Once the index buffer is resident, the driver creates its proprietary index buffer and release the internal index buffer.
 * At this moment the index buffer can be in VRAM, AGP or system memory.
 *
 * The index buffers resident in AGP and VRAM are writeonly, i-e, you can't read them after a lock(). If you change the capacity
 * of the format of a writeonly buffer, the content is lost.
 *
 * Volatile buffers must be completely filled at each pass. They are lost after each swapBuffers(). They are writeonly.
 * Volatile buffers must be resized before the lock call. Only one lock per render must be done with volatile buffers.
