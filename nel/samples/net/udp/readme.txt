Nevrax UDP Bench test.

This program tests the UDP connection between your computer and a Nevrax
server. It reports some stats about packet lost, ping time and other
information.

You can launch this program for 1 minute, 1 hour, all the time if you
want. More often this program will run, more accurate information we'll
have. So if you can, leave this program always running.

Just launch the program and follow instructions.

If you have any problems, please contact lecroart@nevrax.com
