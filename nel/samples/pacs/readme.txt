This sample show how to use PACS to move primitives and test collisions
against others.

For the time, collisions against the landscape are not shown in this 
sample. But they are managed by PACS too.

This sample show:

- Create a simple 3d client
- Creating varius PACS primitives
- Managing a static world image
- Managing several dynamic world image
- Moving PACS primitives
- Managing collisions
- Get triggered information by collisions (flashes)
