## 2026-09-06 — 🐧 Port land_export/ryzom_export to Linux

`ryzom_export` (the NeL/Ryzom level-design export library, `ryzom/tools/leveldesign/export/`) was only ever added to the CMake build under `IF(WIN32)`, so `land_export`/`ryzom_landexport` — which link against it for `CTools`'s file/directory utilities — failed to link on Linux with `cannot find -lryzom_export`.

Ported `CTools` (`export/tools.cpp`): every method now has a POSIX implementation alongside the existing Windows one (`#ifdef NL_OS_WINDOWS`/`#else`), built on `NLMISC::CPath`/`NLMISC::CFile` (`getCurrentPath`/`setCurrentPath`, `createDirectoryTree`, `fileExists`, `getFileModificationDate`, `getPathContent`, `copyFile`). `fileDateCmp`'s FILETIME overload converts the raw Windows FILETIME components (persisted in zone-region data) to a Unix epoch via the standard `(filetime - 116444736000000000) / 10000000` formula.

Ported `CExport::getAllFiles`/`CExport::searchFile` and the ad-hoc directory listing in `CExport::newExport` (`export.cpp`) from `WIN32_FIND_DATA`/`FindFirstFile`/`FindNextFile` to `NLMISC::CPath::getPathContent`-based enumeration, and replaced the remaining raw `GetCurrentDirectory`/`SetCurrentDirectory` calls in `doExport`/`generateIGFromFlora` with the now-portable `CTools::pwd`/`CTools::chdir`. Fixed several hardcoded `"\\"` path separators to `"/"` (`_OutIGDir`, `_InLandscapeDir`, `sContinentDir`, the plant-lookup path in `generateIGFromFlora`, and — found only once Nuno tested the tool for real — four more in `land_export_lib/export.cpp`'s `CExport::treatPattern`).

Discovered mid-port that `CExport::newExport` depends on `SContinentCfg`/`IEasyCFG` (`ryzom/tools/leveldesign/master/ContinentCfg.cpp`/`easy_cfg.cpp`), which live in the `master/` MFC app and were never compiled by any CMake target on any platform. Both files are otherwise fully portable (their `#include "stdafx.h"` is the only Windows-specific line, now guarded); added them directly to `ryzom_export`'s CMake sources instead of pulling in all of `master/`.

`ryzom/tools/leveldesign/CMakeLists.txt`'s `ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(export)` is now gated only by `IF(WITH_LIGO)` (previously also required `IF(WIN32)`); `land_export_lib/CMakeLists.txt` needed no change since it already linked `ryzom_export` unconditionally.

Validated end-to-end: `ryzom_export`, `ryzom_landexport` and `land_export` all build and link successfully via `ryzom-docker`'s tools build, and Nuno confirmed `land_export` runs correctly against real data.
