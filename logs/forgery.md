# Changelog

## 2026-09-07 — ✨ Add landscape_editor app scaffolding, Forgery 3.5.0

New Forgery tool app, `ryzom_forgery/apps/landscape_editor.py`
(`project-todos/forgery/landscape_editor.md` step 1): scaffolding only,
no terrain rendering yet -- window, explorer filtered on `*.land`, free
`OrbitCamera` reused as-is from `camera.py`. Auto-discovered by ryztart via
the existing `APP_INFO`/`list_apps()` mechanism, no separate menu file to
edit.

`OrbitCamera` (and the `ObjectManipulator` it coexists with) reads
`app.forced_drag_mode`/`app.target_mode` every frame -- both undocumented
requirements on any `ForgeryApp` subclass wanting to reuse it (only
discovered by testing: `object_editor.py` happens to set both for its own
navcube-driven drag-mode overrides, but nothing enforces or documents that a
camera-only consumer must too). Set to `None` (no override) in
`LandscapeEditorApp.__init__`.

Also reordered `project-todos/forgery/landscape_editor.md`'s own steps 1-2:
the plan originally had "finish continent-selector sub-chantier" before
"create the app", but continent-selector's own step 3 needs the app's panel
to already exist to add its dropdown to -- a circular dependency, fixed by
swapping the two steps.

## 2026-09-07 — ✨ Add continent selector + real region bounds, Forgery 3.6.0

`project-todos/forgery/landscape_editor__continent-selector.md` closed.
Added `ryzom_forgery/continent_selector.py`
(`load_continent_locations()`/`resolve_continent_bounds()`) and wired a
continent-picker dropdown + resolved bounds display into
`landscape_editor.py`'s panel, reading `world.packed_sheets`/
`continent.packed_sheets`/`sheet_id.bin` from the same `live_data_path`
global setting Patina (`object_editor.py`) already exposes.

`resolve_continent_bounds()` reproduces `CContinent::getCorners()`:
`ContinentParameters.zone_min`/`zone_max` are zone names (not raw
coordinates), decoded via `pynel.ryzom_packed_sheets.zone_name_to_world_pos()`,
each axis reordered min/max (a zone name's letter/digit order isn't
guaranteed ascending), and +160 added to the max corner (a zone name gives
its origin corner, not its extent).

Two real-data surprises found only by testing against a real install (both
corrected in the sub-chantier's own notes, the initial plan had guessed
wrong on both):
- `ContLoc.continent_name` is the bare sheet stem with **no extension**
  (e.g. `"bagne"`), not `"bagne.continent"` as the original investigation
  assumed -- the `.continent` suffix has to be appended before looking the
  name up in `sheet_id.bin`.
- `sheet_id.bin` is **not** a loose file in the Ryzom Live data folder,
  unlike `creature.packed_sheets`/`world.packed_sheets`/
  `continent.packed_sheets` -- it only exists packed inside
  `leveldesign.bnp`. `continent_selector.py` tries the loose file first,
  then falls back to reading it out of `leveldesign.bnp` via
  `pynel.ryzom_bnp.BnpReader`.

Validated against a real Ryzom Live install: all 28 real continents resolve
bounds without error.
