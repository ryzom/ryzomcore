This interface allows you to see the progression of your skills and the progression of your actions.

<h4>Skill Tree</h4>
The <a href="ah:context_help&target=ui:interface:phrase_book:content:content:sbtree&text=uiSkillTree">Skill Tree</a> allows you to see the state of your skills. <BR>
You have the current level of the skill over it's max level (eg: Craft: 1/20</a>). <BR>
The bar indicate the progression in the current skill level. <BR>
The color of the skill indicates either: <BR>
	- transparent: skill not trained <BR>
	- orange: skill currently trained <BR>
	- green: skill completed <BR>
<BR>
When you complete a skill, new skills are opened. you can browse the skill tree, clicking on "+". <BR>
The whole skill tree is not displayed. Only completed skills, currently trained skills, 
and the untrained skills that relies directly on a trained skill are displayed. <BR>
<h4>Actions</h4>
The Actions part shows the actions you can learn or the actions you have learnt at each skill level. <BR>
You have to <a href="ah:context_help&target=ui:interface:phrase_book:content:content:sbtree:tree_list:0&itext=Select">select a skill</a> to see the actions related to this skill. <BR>
The actions you have not learnt are grayed. <BR>
The actions you can either not learn because the requirements are not met (e.g.: you don't reach the required skill level) are in Red. <BR>
The actions are separated in two groups: 
<a href="ah:context_help&target=ui:interface:phrase_book:content:tab_group:action_select:tab0&text=uitabPhraseActions">Actions</a>, and 
<a href="ah:context_help&target=ui:interface:phrase_book:content:tab_group:action_select:tab1&text=uitabPhraseUpgrades">Action Upgrades</a>.<BR>
You can drag and drop an Action to your action bar, while you cannot drag an Action Upgrade because they are either characteristic upgrades, or action upgrade
which are not castable.<BR>
