<h1>How to extract raw materials from a source</h1>
<P>Prerequisite : <A HREF="ah:launch_help&url=how_to_findrawmaterialsources.html">How to find raw material sources</A></P>
<p>
<h4>For beginners</h4>
You must ensure that you have a foraging tool in your hand (typically a pick).
Look at the right hand slot of the 'hands bar'.
Click on the source to target it.
Click a second time to begin extraction.
This will start running the default foraging action repeatedly.
</P>
<h4>Advanced</h4>
<P>
When you know several foraging actions, either learnt from your forager trainer
or built by yourself with combined stanzas, you can click the action you want to start,
on the 'hands bar', depending on the most appropriate action you want to do. Then, during
an extraction, you can switch from one action to another. For example, if the extraction
gets dangerous (watch the glow and colour of the source, or the 'extraction risk' bar),
you should rush at a Ground Stability care action, or the source will blow up!
</p>
<p>
Actions that are more effective are often more dangerous too. Damage
caused by your actions can result in explosions, poisonous gas clouds
or even in provoking the wrath of the local Kamis.
</p>
<p>
The default foraging action, used if you click a source twice, is the leftmost and topmost
foraging action in the 'hands' bar. Then you can assign it to any action you want.
</p>
<p>
Unlike combat actions, all extraction actions are cyclic.
This means that you only need to click on an action once to start performing it and it will repeat indefinitely - or at least until you click on another action or stop extracting.
