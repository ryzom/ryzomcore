<h1>How to cast offensive spells</h1>
<P>
In order to cast offensive spells, you must target a foe by clicking on them and then clicking on the spell icon in the 'Hands Bar' interface.
You cannot cast offensive spells against the NPCs in the towns and villages.<BR>
Most of the game areas are not flagged as PvP meaning that you will not be able to cast offensive spells against other players in these areas.
