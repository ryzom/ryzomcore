<h1>How to heal yourself</h1>
<P>
You will recover naturally from damage inflicted to you by foes.
You will recover faster if you sit down than if you remain standing.
The rate at which you heal is determined by your Metabolism score.<br>

You can also heal yourself with powers called “self heal life” you can find by your trainers.
If the power does not appear in your hands bar, drop it from your progression windows or create it by right clicking on a free slot of the hands bar.
Now that you have the “self heal life” power in your hands bar, just click on the icon to activate it.
You don’t need to target yourself to perform this action.<br>

You can also use the “restore sap” and “restore stamina” stanzas in this power to heal your sap points or your stamina points.
Each time that you create a “self heal” power, you need to choose a time credit wich define how long your self heal abilities will be disabled.
Note that this timer is common to ALL self heals…so you cannot use a self heal hit points power and use a self heal stamina just after it.
