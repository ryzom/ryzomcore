<h1>Where to find raw material sources</h1>
<p>
In order to use 'extraction' actions you will need to locate a 'raw material source'.
Sources have a green phosphorescent glow and a green name over them.
Sources appear randomly in some areas of the world.
Their appearance can also be provoked by players with prospecting actions. 
</P>
<h4>Where are my prospecting actions ?</h4>
<P>
You have a prospecting action only if you started with enough 'forage' action packs.
If you don't have the prospecting action, at first you will have to extract either some randomly-appearing sources or extract sources prospected by another homin.
After some experience in extracting, your Forager Trainer will accept to teach you a prospecting action.
</P>
<P>
However, if you didn't choose any 'forage' action pack and you want to retrain into a forager career,
you will have to learn even an extracting action from your favorite trainer.
</P>
<h4>How to look for specific raw materials?</h4>
<P>
When your skill will be sufficient, your Forager Trainer will teach you new prospecting actions. Gradually,
they will allow you to refine your search...
</P>
<h4>I have found a raw material source, now what?</h4>
<P>
Once you can find or provoke the appearance of a raw material source, see <A HREF="ah:launch_help&url=how_to_extractrawmaterialsfromasource.html">How to extract raw materials</A>.
