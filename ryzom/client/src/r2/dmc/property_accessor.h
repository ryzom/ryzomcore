		/** Add a local value that prevails over the network value when read from this property accessor
		  * 'localValue' is a value supplied by the caller. When getPropertyValue will be called on 'shadowedValue', then
		  * 'localValue' will be returned instead, thus shadowing the original value.
		  * Any previous value that is shadowing the original value will be deleted when calling 'shadowValue'
		  *
		  * Intended usage is to modify a value locally on the client while it is being edited and before its value is commited
		  * Typically example is the slider in the client ui :
		  * While moving a slider the client wants to have instant feedback of the value on the screen.
		  * Update of screen content is usually done by implementing event handlers that are triggered when a property of an object
		  * changes. Unless the shadowing system is used, a property change can only occur when the corresponding network msg
		  * is received. So each time the slider move, we should send a requestSetNode or similar network message and wait for it to return back to our client (edition
		  * messages are repeated to all editing clients)
		  *
		  * This is not desirable in the case of sliders, because too many messages would be generated while the user move the mouse.
		  * Instead we only want to send a net message when the user release the mouse button
		  *
		  * pattern of use :
		  *
		  * - While a property is being edited, 'shadowValue' should be called. Posssibly notification of property change should be fired by the caller.
		  *   any call to CPropertyAccessor::getPropertyValue will return the shadowed value instead of
		  * - If value is confirmed : 'commitValue' should be called, and the matching requestxxx  method should be called to notify the server that the value has changed.
		  *                           current local value is copied into. Possibly, notification of property change should be fired.
		  * - If value is canceled  : 'rollbackValue' should be called. Possibly, notification of property change should be fired.
