<p>This interface references all of the animals in your posession. It
closely resembles the 'team' interface.<br>
<h4>Basics</h4>
<a href="">Selection</a>: In order to select an animal you must click
on its name. You can only select animals that are physically close to
you. Clicking on the name of animal who is too far away has no effect.
<br><a href="">Orders</a>: The context menu on the right mouse button is
used to give orders to your animals. Click the right mouse button on
the name of an animal in order to give it individual orders. Click the
right mouse button on the title bar of the animals interface in order
to give the same orders to all of the animals at once.
<br><a href="">Stables</a>: When you are close to stable buildings you can
order your animals to enter or leave. Stables are places where your
animals are safe. Given that your animals can be attacked and cannot be
resurreted when they die, you are strongly recomended to leave your
animals in stables whenever you don't have an immediate need for them.
There is a stable building located at the entrance to each town and
village. Note that when you are close to the stables where your animals
are located you continue to the inventories of items that they are
carrying.
<br><h4>Description</h4>
<a href="">Name or Type</a>: Indicates whether an animal is a steed or
a pack animal.
<br><a href="">Weight</a>: Displays the total weight carried by your
animal (a value followed by the 'weight' icon). Weight has no impact at
all on your pack animals. The value is purely informative.
<br><a href="">Life</a>:The red bar represents your animal's life (hit
points). When the bar is empty your animal will die. A dead animal
cannot be brought back to life. One can only retrieve the items that
they were carrying.
<br><a href="">Bulk</a>: The yellow bar (the last bar) represents the bulk
of the items carried by the animal.
When the bar is full it becomes impossible to add more items to the
animal's inventory.
<br><a href="">Inventory</a>: The icon depicting a chest (displayed on the
right) gives access to the items transported by an animal. You are
always allowed to look at the items carried by all of your animals.
However, you cannot do anything with items that are carried by animals
who are not near by.
