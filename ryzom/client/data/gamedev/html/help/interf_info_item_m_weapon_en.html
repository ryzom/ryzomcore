Melee weapons are used to inflict damage on your ennemies in close combat.
Some melee weapons give you bonuses or penalties for your Hp, Sap, Stamina and/or Focus stats when they are carried in your right hand.<br>
<h4>Basics</h4>
<a href="">Origin</a> : The origin of this item.<br>
<a href="">Quality</a> : The quality of this weapon.
Your skill level should be at least equivalent to this quality value in order to use this item as its best.<br>
<a href="">Weight</a> : The weight of this item.
If the total weight is too high, your movement speed may be slowed.<br>
<a href="">Bulk</a> : How much space the item takes in your inventory.
Space in each inventory is limited meaning that bulky itms cannot be carried in large numbers.<br>
<a href="">Hit Points</a> : The hit points of this item.
This value will degrade with use of the weapon.
When it reaches 0, the item is destroyed.<br>
<a href="">Sap Load</a> : Represents the capacity of an item to be enchanted.
Items can be enchanted with the use of Crystalised Spell items so long as the sap required for each charge of the crystalised spell is inferior to the
maximum sap that the item can be charged up with.
The first value displayed here represents that current sap charge on the item.
The second value represnts the maximum sap charge that the item can hold.
Applying a new Crystalised Spell will reduce the current sap load on the item to 0 and replace the previous enchantment with the new one represented by the applied crystal.<br>
<a href="">Skill</a> : The skill this item requires.<br>
<h4>Melee Weapon related</h4>

Many enemies resist better to some damage types than to others.<br>

The Damage may be much less than Max Damage if the 'quality' stat of the weapon is superior to your skill level.<br>
<a href="">Max Damage</a> : The maximum damage you can inflict with this weapon.
This is the damage that you will be able to inflict if your skill level is equal or superior to the value of the weapon's 'Quality' parameter.<br>
<a href="">Hits/Minute</a> : The hit rate of this weapon.<br>
<a href="">Reach</a> : The reach of this weapon. The more this reach is higher than the ennemy's reach, the more your hits succeed.<br>
