Range weapons are used to inflict damage on your ennemies in range
combat. You need ammunition to use range weapons.Some range weapons
give you bonuses or penalties for your Hp, Sap, Stamina and/or Focus
stats when they are carried in your right hand. <br>
<h4>Basics</h4>
<a href="">Origin</a>: The origin of this item. <br>
<a href="">Quality</a>: The quality of this weapon. Your skill level
should be at least equivalent to this quality value in order to use
this item as its best. <br>
<a href="">Weight</a>: The weight of this item. If the total weight is
too high, your movement speed may be slowed. <br>
<a href="">Bulk</a>: How much space the item takes in your inventory.
Space in each
inventory is limited meaning that bulky itms cannot be carried in large
numbers. <br>
<a href="">Hit Points</a>: The hit points of this item. This value will
degrade with use of the weapon. When it reaches 0, the item is
destroyed. <br>
<a href="">Sap Load</a>: Represents the capacity of an item to be
enchanted. Items can be enchanted with the use of Crystalised Spell
items so long as the sap required for each charge of the crystalised
spell is inferior to the maximum sap that the item can be charged up
with. The first value displayed here represents that current sap charge
on the item. The second value represnts the maximum sap charge that the
item can hold. Applying a new Crystalised Spell will reduce the current
sap load on the item to 0 and replace the previous enchantment with the
new one represented by the applied crystal.&nbsp;<br>
