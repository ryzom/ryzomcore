<p>Introduction</p>
<p><br>
  In this chapter &quot;How to buy from and sell to a bot&quot;, we shall explain 
  to you how to buy items from and sell items to non playing characters (bots) 
  that you will come across in Ryzom. This is an essential step in the acquisition 
  of new property as well as in gaining wealth.</p>
<p><br>
  In order to tackle this chapter with serenity, it is necessary to first have 
  become familiar with the &quot;How to talk to a bot&quot; chapter and to have 
  read &quot;What's an item, an ability&quot;. </p>
<p><br>
  You need money (or items to sell) to make a purchase. We advise you to complete 
  the first mission that your rolemaster proposes to you. </p>
