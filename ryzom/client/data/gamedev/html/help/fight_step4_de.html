<p>Step 4: Development and end of a combat </p>
<p>Throughout the action, messages inform you on the progress of the combat. </p>
<p><img src="../Graph/fight/fight_attack02_256_128.tga"> </p>
<p>This information window gives info on your hits or misses as well as those 
  of your adversary(ies).</p>
<p> <img src="../Graph/fight/fight_attack03_256.tga"></p>
<p>The life bar above characters and creatures:</p>
<p>According to the color code you will know if you or the creature are full of 
  life (green bar), wounded (yellow to orange bar), nearly dead (red bar). </p>
<p>Each hit is accompanied by a red figure preceded by a &quot;-&quot; sign which 
  escapes from the wounded target (inversely, if the target benefits from a spell 
  allowing him/her to recover life points, a green figure preceded by a &quot;+&quot; 
  sign escapes from that target).</p>
<p>You can stop the combat at any time:<br>
  - Move away <br>
  - Right click on the adversary who you are fighting and choose &quot;DISENGAGE&quot;.</p>
<p>However, the adversary may want to continue fighting. This is why we advise 
  you to return quickly to a zone under allied control and your adversary will 
  be either be rendered harmless or will run away.<br>
