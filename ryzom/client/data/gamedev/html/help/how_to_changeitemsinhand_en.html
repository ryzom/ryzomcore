<p>The item that you are holding in your right hand is displayed at the right hand end of the 'action bar' interface.
If the item takes up both of your hands, then a copy of the icon also appears in a half tone at the left hand end of the action bar.</p>
<br><p>In order to change the item in your right hand, click on the icon at the right end of the Hands Bar.
A pop-up window will appear showing all of the items in your inventory that can be carried in your right hand.
Click on the item to equip it.</p>
<br><p>Note that items in your hands can't be used for a few seconds after they are changed.
The action icons in the action bar are all displayed in gray to represent that they cannot be used during this time.
