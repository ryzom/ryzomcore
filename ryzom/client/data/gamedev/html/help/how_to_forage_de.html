<h1>How to Forage</h1>
<p>
Foraging comprises two types of action :<br>
<ul>
  <li>Prospection : Allows you to locate resource springs.
  Different prospecting actions allow you to control the size of the area to search,
  the type of resources you're looking for and their level of quality.</li>
  <li>Extraction : Allows you to extract the resources from a spring.
  Different extraction actions allow you to trade off raw material quality against quantity and action aggressiveness.
  Aggressive actions can result in all kinds of nasty side effects from explosions and poisonous gas clouds to provoking the wrath of the local Kamis.</li>
</ul>
Note that you do not have to master the art of prospection in order to
begin foraging in the game. In certain places resource springs appear
spontaneously. Others will appear as a result of the prospecting
actions of other players. Several players can extract resources from
the same source at the same time.<br>
