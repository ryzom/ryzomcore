<P>
In order to cast offensive spells, you must target a foe by clicking on them and then clicking on the spell icon in the 'action bar' interface.
You cannot cast offensive spells against the NPCs in the towns and villages.</p>

<br><p>
Most of the game areas are not flagged as PvP, meaning that you will not be able to cast offensive spells against other players in these areas.
