<p>Step 4: Modifying the camera <br>
  Depending on the situation you will probably like to change cameras. For this 
  you may alter several parameters while you play. </p>
<p>To go from 1st person view to 3rd person view:<br>
  - Turn the mouse wheel towards you. <br>
  or<br>
  - Press the letter V on your keyboard.</p>
<p>To go from 3rd person view to 1st person view:<br>
  -Turn the mouse wheel away from you.<br>
  or<br>
  -Press the letter V on your keyboard.</p>
<p>To modify the inclination of the camera in 3rd person view:<br>
  Press &quot;PAGE DOWN&quot; to raise the camera. This movement is limited when 
  the camera is vertical to the character.<br>
  Press &quot;PAGE UP&quot; to lower the camera.</p>
<p>To modify the inclination and the angle of the camera in the 3rd person view 
  when the character is at a standstill: </p>
<p><img src="../Graph/camera_character/pivoter_256.tga"> </p>
<p><br>
  Right click while moving the mouse to the right, the left, upwards, downwards.<br>
  You can observe an action as you do it, otherwise your character will always 
  seek to turn her/his back to the camera. </p>
