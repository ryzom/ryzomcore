<P>
Actions are spells or abilities you can use. You can build an action by assembling stanzas together through the action bar.<BR>
<BR>
<a href="">Action Cost</a>: indicate the total cost of the action.<BR>
<a href="">Action Credit</a>: indicate the total credit of the action. The Action credit has to be greater or 
equal to the Action cost, else the action is not valid. <BR>
<BR>
<a href="">Success rate</a>: indicate the chance to succeed in this action. The success rate depends on the skill related 
to this action. Moreover if you add extra stanza credit, the success rate may increase. <BR>
	- For Fight actions: the success rate depends on the skill of the weapon you wear. <BR>
	- For Magic actions: the success rate depends on the skills of the magic stanzas you use. <BR>
	- For Craft actions: the success rate depends on your skill for crafting different item. <BR>
	- For Harvest actions: the success rate depends on where you harvest and the stanzas you use. <BR>
<a href="">Cast Duration</a>: (not for fight) the time to perform this action <BR>
<a href="">Energy consumed</a>: indicate the amount of Sap, Stamina, Focus or Hp consumed when executing this action <BR>
<a href="">Range</a>: (magic and powers only) indicate the max distance at which you can cast this spell <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For rolemaster actions only (actions in the Action Progression window for instance), you have also the <a href="">Requirements</a> section
to know the skills or stanzas you must develop before learning this action: <BR>
<BR>
<a href="">Skill Points</a>: how much remains to buy this action / total cost. When all the stanzas of an action 
are learnt, the first number is 0, and the action is ungrayed in the Action Progression window. <BR>
<a href="">Skills required</a>: indicate precisely the skills you have to develop and the level you have to reach in those 
skills. The skill requirements not met are in Red.<BR>
NB: some actions like "Constitution Training" requires that you develop either one skill OR an other.<BR>
<a href="">Stanzas required</a>: some actions requires also that you learn some stanzas before you can learn this action.
The stanza requirements not met are in Red.<BR>
For instance, you cannot learn the action "Constitution 2" if you haven't learn the action "Constitution 1".<BR>
NB: this is a "stanza requirement", and not an "action requirement" because you can learn the same stanza from different actions.<BR>
