This interface allows you to buy and sell items to a NPC.
</P>
<P>
<h4>Sell List</h4>
The Sell List allows you to sell your items (either from your Bag, or from a Pack Animal). <BR>
When You sell an item to a NPC, this NPC will resell it to other players under certain conditions:<BR>
	- Raw Materials can always be resold<BR>
	- Item freshly crafted (i.e. never damaged) such as swords, armors, ammo etc... can be resold<BR>
<BR>
When you sell an item to the NPC, it will ask you a 'Resale Price' which is the 'Basic Price' multiplied by 2 by default. 
Other players will be able to buy this item at this 'Resale Price'.<BR>
Following rules are applied for those prices:<BR>
	- When you sell the item to the NPC, you receive immediatly the 'Basic Price'<BR>
	- You will receive the difference 'Resale Price' - 'Basic Price' once some player buy your item<BR>
<BR>
Note: you can sell any item to any NPC. For instance, you can sell swords to Raw Material merchant.<BR>
<BR>

<h4>Buy List</h4>
The 'Buy List' allows you to buy items from NPC. There is 2 Lists: <BR>
	- 'Players and NPC Sale' shows all the items put in resale by all players and the one sold by merchant. <BR>
		Note: you'll see only items of type and quality related to the merchant (e.g.: players swords resale won't be seen at the Raw Materials Merchant, and you won't see Swords of quality 100 at the Weapon Merchant of quality 20-50)<BR>
		Note: NPC items are usually of higher price and lesser interest than Players 's items.<BR>
	- 'Your Sale' shows all the items you have sold and that are waiting for resale. NB: Unlike 'Players Sale' you see all your items sold here (not filtered by type or quality)<BR>
<BR>
In the 'Your Sale' tab, and sometimes in the 'Players and NPC Sale' tab, you'll see items that were sold by you (marked with yellow text). You can retire those items so you can change the Resale Price.<BR>
<BR>
Note: Items are resold within a certain amount of time. You can see the resale time left for each item you have put in resale. After this time, the item is lost (kept by the NPC)
