<P>You will recover naturally from damage inflicted to you by foes.
You will recover faster if you sit down than if you remain standing.
The rate at which you heal is determined by your Metabolism score.</p>

<br><p>You can also heal yourself with powers called "self heal life", which you can get from trainers.
If the stanza does not appear in your action bar, drag and drop it from your action progression window or 
create it by right clicking on a free slot of the action bar.
Now that you have the "self heal life" stanza in your action bar, just click on the icon to activate it.
You donâ€™t need to target yourself to perform this action.</p>

<br><p>You can also use the "restore sap" and "restore stamina" stanzas in this stanza to heal your sap points or your stamina points.
Each time that you create a "self heal" stanza, you need to choose a time credit wich define how long your self heal abilities will be disabled.
Note that this timer is common to ALL self heals, so you cannot use a self heal life stanza and use a self heal stamina immediately after it.
