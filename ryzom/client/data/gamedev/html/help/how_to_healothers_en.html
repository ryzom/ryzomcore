<p>In order to heal other players you will need a heal spell (not a "self" power).
If you do not have one, you will need to learn one from the magic trainer.</p>
<br><p>You need to target the player you wish to heal and click on the healing spell icon in the action bar.
If the stanza does not appear in your action bar, drag and drop it from your action progression window.
or create it by right clicking on a free slot of the action bar.
Note that if you only have a "self" power, you will not be able to heal other players.
