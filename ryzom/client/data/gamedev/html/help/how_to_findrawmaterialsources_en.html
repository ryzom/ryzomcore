In order to use 'extraction' actions you will need to locate a raw material source.
Sources have a green phosphorescent glow and a green name over them.
Sources appear randomly in some areas of the world.
They can also be made to appear by players with prospecting actions. 
</p>
<br><h4>Where are my prospecting actions?</h4>
<p>
You should have a basic prospecting action in your action bar. If the stanza does not appear in your action bar, drag and drop it from your action progression window.
or create it by right clicking on a free slot of the action bar.

<br><h4>How to look for specific raw materials?</h4>
<p>
When your skill is sufficient, your Forager Trainer will teach you new prospecting actions. Gradually,
they will allow you to refine your search.
</p>
<br><h4>I have found a raw material source, now what?</h4>
<p>
Once you have prospected a raw material source, see <a href="ah:launch_help&url=how_to_extractrawmaterialsfromasource.html">How to extract raw materials</a>.
