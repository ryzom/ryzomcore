<p>Step 2: Melee and range weapons </p>
<p>Melee weapons all arms used in close combat. These are generally hand weapons. 
  You need to be close enough to the target to attack him/her. </p>
<p>Range weapons include all weapons used at a distance from the target. Ammunition 
  must be provided for these arms to use them. If you have no more ammunition 
  in stock then the weapon will not work.</p>
<p><br>
  Recommendation: before engaging in combat evaluate the adversary and check 
  that you have enough ammunition in stock. If it is your first encounter with 
  the adversary, get help from other players or stay near allied patrolling guards.
