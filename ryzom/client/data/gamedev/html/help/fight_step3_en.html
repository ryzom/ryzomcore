<p>Step 3: Launching an attack </p>
<p>Whether using melee or range weapons combat is triggered off in the same way. 
  Remember, when combat is engaged your life is at stake. It is up to you to carefully 
  evaluate your adversary, to provide yourself with a retreat area in case things 
  don't go according to plan. </p>
<p><img src="../Graph/fight/fight_attack01_128_256.tga"></p>
<p>Right click on the target and choose &quot;ATTACK&quot;. Provided you are at 
  the right distance you will use the weapon with which your character is equipped 
  to eliminate the adversary.</p>
<p>Combat is engaged.</p>
<p><b>Your character uses his/her weapon automatically until either the adversary 
  or you are killed. </b></p>
<p>Warning, the adversary may well engage combat on seeing you. It is then up 
  to you to decide whether to flee or to engage in combat. </p>
