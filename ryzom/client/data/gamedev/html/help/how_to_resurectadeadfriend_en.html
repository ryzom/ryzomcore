In Ryzom, players who lose all of their hit points fall into a coma.
When they are in a coma their hit point bar starts to fill up with a
deep red color. When the bar is completely full they die and must
choose a respawn point to re-spawn. Comatose players can be revived.
Dead players cannot.</p>

<br><p>You can revive players by casting heal spells on their comatose
bodies.
Each heal spell makes the deep red bar recede. Casting sufficient heal
spells to completely eliminate the dark red brings the comatose player
back to life.
