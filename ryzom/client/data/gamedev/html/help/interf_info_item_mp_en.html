Raw materials are the basis to craft items such as swords, armors, rocket launcher etc... <br>
They can be quartered on dead creatures, or foraged in the ground if you have foraging skills.<br>

<a href="">Weight</a> : The weight of this item. If the total weight is too high, your movement speed may be slowed.<br>
<a href="">Bulk</a> : How much space the item takes in your inventory. Space in each inventory is limited meaning that bulky itms cannot be carried in large numbers.<br>

<a href="">Ecosystem</a> : Where this material can be found.<br>
