About the project : client_background_downloader_extern_res :
==============================================================

When including an external resource file in a .exe, VC++6 doesn't detect properly that the file
has changed, and the resource file rebuild does not occur.
To solve this problem, this utility project add a custom build step on the external files to "touch" the resource file,
if these file are detected to be modified -> this force a recompilation of the resource file.
The project is added as a dependency of client_background_downloader to ensure that this step will be taken first.
For now, the final client_background_downaloder_rd.exe has the language files included has resources.
