Introduction
------------

Ryzom Core is a software platform for creating and running massively multi-user
entertainment in a 3D environment over the Internet.

The Ryzom Core library is further divided into specific modules: network, ai, 3d
and misc. If you want to use any of these, you also need to use the misc
part of the library, but ai, 3d and network are totally independant from
each other so you can use only the parts you really need in your project.

If you want know more about the library content and functionalities, you
should take a look on the documents present in the doc directory.

Ryzom Core is currently developed and tested under GNU/Linux and Windows
environments.
