/**
 * Database group.
 *
 * A group type is identified by a TCDBBank enum.
 * One recipient CAN'T belong to several groups of the same bank (ex: one player can belong
 * to 0 or 1 guild).
 *
 * What are the main advantages of using a CCDBGroup instead of duplicating changes
 * on several character's databases?
 * - Less user code.
 * - The data are shared, and the change trackers are shared as well (less memory needed).
 * - The delta buffer is built only once per tick (less CPU).
 * - The delta buffer is sent in one message to a FS (less network traffic).
 * - The number of bits used to locate properties is lower, as there is one tree per bank (less
 * network traffic).
 *
 * How to use the database system?
 * Here is a tutorial, it explains how CCDBGroup is used in the EGS.
 *
 * A. Put a CCDBSynchronised database in the character class.
 *    Put a CCDBGroup in each group class (eg. in a guild class).
 *    Init them with the corresponding banks.
 *
 * B. At each game cycle, here is the using process:
 *
 * 1. To populate a CCDBGroup, use addRecipient()/removeRecipient(). addRecipient() will send to it all
 *    modifications in the group database since the beginning. removeRecipient() will ask the client to
 *    reset the corresponding data, so that a new addRecipient() would work (the delta values need be
 *    done with 0 as the reference value).
 *
 * 2. Your code sets some properties using Database.setProp(), either database of a particular character
 *    or the database in a CCDBGroup (in database.xml, the branch banks must have been set likewise).
 *
 * 3. Now you want to build a delta buffer for all characters, including modifications for groups and
 *    particular characters.
 *    Call sendDeltas() on each CCDBGroup object. You may provide maxBitSize to limit the space used by
 *    these groups. You need not call writeDelta() on the Database object in a CCDBGroup. A message will
 *    be emitted to all front-ends, to send the changes to all the recipients of the group.
 *
 * 4. Call writeDelta() on the CCDBSynchronised database of every character.
 *    You should provide maxBitSize to limit the size of the message.
 *    The recommended available size should be provided by the network emitting system (front-end service).
 *    Push the outbox bitmemstream of every character into an output message. You should differenciate the
 *    initial message with other updates so that the client can react differently (it will not call any
 *    observers for the initial message). Note: you can know the "not sent yet" flag in CCDBSynchronized
 *    database, using setAsSent()/notSentYet(). Send the message.
