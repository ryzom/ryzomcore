		<P>Start an emot for one or more bot.</p>
		<P>
		Emot list is available in a george file here 
		<a href="../../../Game_elem/emot/list.emot">list.emot</a><BR>
		As events and actions are group wide, you could specifie 
		the name of one or more bots (for named bot) or the number of one or more
		bots (in a group of non named bots) that will play the emot.<BR>
		If no name or number filter are found, then all the bots in the group will
		play the same emot. This is not an issue for groups with only one bot.
		<P>
		If the action is triggered from a <B>'player_follow_npc'</B> or
		<B>'player_target_npc'</B> event, then the followed or targeted bot will be
		automaticaly selected to play the emot. In this case, bot_name and bot_number 
		are simply ignored.
