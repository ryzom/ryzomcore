<P>This event is triggered when a special reserved timer called the 'state timeout' timer is 
triggered.</P>
<P>This timer should be used to time idle states as it may 
be interrogated by ai_profile code and its value taken into account&nbsp;for decision 
making.</P>
<P>The state timeout timer is reset to a 'dissabled' each 
time the state changes, before the 'start_of_state' event is 
triggered</P>
<P>The timeout timer may be suspended during punctual 
states if the action 'suspend_state_timeout' is triggered on start of the punctual 
state.</P></BODY></HTML>
