/**
@interface ICoreListener
@brief The ICoreListener is an interface for providing a hook for plugins to veto on close event emitted from
the core plugin.
@details You implement this interface if you want to prevent the closing of the whole application.
If the application window requests a close, then first ICoreListener::closeMainWindow() is called
(in arbitrary order) on all registered objects implementing this interface.
If one if these calls returns false, the process is aborted and the event is ignored.  If all calls return
true, the corresponding signal is emitted and the event is accepted/performed.

You need to add your implementing object to the plugin managers objects:
PluginManager->addObject(yourImplementingObject);
Don't forget to remove the object again at deconstruction (e.g. in the destructor of
your plugin)
